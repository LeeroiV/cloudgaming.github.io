<h2>Present</h2>
<p align="left">
Cloud gaming, or playing a game on a remote server instead of a local machine, is alive and well— and growing. Where services like G-cluster, OnLive, and GameFly Streaming have not remained in power, larger companies like Google and Microsoft are working on their own cloud gaming service. Companies like Tencent are partnering with other tech giants to create larger and better cloud gaming facilities.
